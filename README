FILES INCLUDED

shell.c (shell.h) - Contains the main method of the program and 
most of the computations/manipulations happening.

list.c (list.h) - Contains the basic implementation of a linked list. It 
should be noted that to create these files I based them off of a linked 
list implementation that I had previosuly written for COMS W3157.


COMMENTS

Based on how a real shell operates with history, I included commands that 
had caused errors, or were not even really commands. I also included 
history in the history listings, but the history listing that was just 
called will not appear in the list for that time. Upon the next history 
call you will see the previous history call somewhere in the list.

I did not have time to run checkpath.pl and check the style, so I 
apologize for the potentially large amount of style errors you might
find.

All of the basic functionality should be up and running, but the 
error checking in general is not that robust. Specifically with 
subtracting paths is a little spotty. I remove trailing / and add 
leading / to all paths entered into the paths list but I allow for 
duplicates in there. Then when path - [name] is called, the program 
is only able to remove one of the items if there was a duplicate.
