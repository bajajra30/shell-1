FILES INCLUDED

shell.c (shell.h) - Contains the main method of the program and 
most of the computations/manipulations happening.

list.c (list.h) - Contains the basic implementation of a linked list. It 
should be noted that to create these files I based them off of a linked 
list implementation that I had previously written for COMS W3157.


DESIGN COMMENTS

All necessary functionality is up and running. In order to run basic 
commands, the path must be added to the paths list (path + /usr/bin). 
Additional paths can be added or subtracted with path +/- command 
functionality. The "history" command will allow the user to view the 
previously entered commands.
